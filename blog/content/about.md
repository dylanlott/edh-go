# About 

## What is EDH Go?

EDH Go is a way to represent board states in a minimal, mobile and desktop compatible way. It's setup for an environment where social trust is present, like kitchen-table games but over the internet. We trade off rigidity in the game engine for simplicity and flexibility in the spirit of EDH.

## Design Ethos

Everything in Magic is a stack, so we stuck with that basic principle and designed everything in EDH Go around this.
